# Atlas Blueprint Blog

This repository contains a starter Blueprint to get you up and running quickly on [WP Engine's Atlas platform](https://wpengine.com/atlas/) with a simple WordPress blog site.

## Status of code

Please note that while this repository is public it is not yet complete. It is not recommended that you use this site, as it is, on a production website as it will continue to be built out to a stable state throughout the second quarter of 2022.
